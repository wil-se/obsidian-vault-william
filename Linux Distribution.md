# Linux Distribution
----
A Linux distribution (distro) is an [[Operating System]] based on the [[Linux Kernel]] and a set of applications compatible with it.
A tipical Linux disto comprises also [[GNU Project|GNU]] tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a [[Windowing System]], a [[Window Manager]] and a [[Desktop Environment]].

Almost one thousand Linux distributions  exist. Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken a wide variety of forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, tablets and embedded systems.
