# C

C is a general-purpose programming language. C was originally designed for and implemented on the [[UNIX]] [[Operating System]].
A C program consists of _functions_ and _variables_. A function contains _statements_ that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation.
Every program written in C must have a _main_ somewhere.
