# Rust (programming language)
#### Memory-safe, multi-paradigm programming language

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's borrow checker tracks the object lifetime and variable scope of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including functional programming constructs.
Software developer Graydon Hoare designed Rust while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Mozilla officially sponsored the project in 2009, and the designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine and the Rust compiler. Rust's major influences include SML, OCaml, C++, Cyclone, Haskell, and Erlang. Since the first stable release in January 2014, Rust has been adopted by companies including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), and Microsoft.
Rust has been noted for its growth as a newer language and has been the subject of academic programming languages research.
