# Distributed Ledger
----
A distributed ledger is the consensus of replicated, shared and synchronized digital data that is geographically spread across many sites, countries or institutions. A distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single central point of failure.
In general, a distributed ledger requires a peer to peer computer network and a consensus algorithm. The data is spread across multiple nodes on the network, where each node stores an identical copy of the ledger data and updates itself independetly of other nodes. All the nodes use the same consensus algorithm to determine the correct copy of the updated ledger.
This technology creates an immutable [[Database]].
