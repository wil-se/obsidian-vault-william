# Computer architecture
#### Set of rules describing computer system

In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. The architecture of a system refers to its structure in terms of separately specified components of that system and their interrelationships.
Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation. In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.
The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, describing the analytical engine. When building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad Zuse described in two patent applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data, i.e., the stored-program concept. Two other early and important examples are:

[[Processor register]]
[[Central processing unit]]
[[Direct memory access]]
[[Assembly language]]
[[C (programming language)]]
[[Java (programming language)]]
[[Computer science]]
[[Embedded system]]
[[Computer network]]
[[Operating system]]
[[Programming language]]
[[Formal language]]
[[Algorithm]]
[[Database]]
[[Computer security]]
[[Cryptography]]
[[Concurrency (computer science)]]
[[Parallel computing]]
[[Artificial intelligence]]
[[Machine learning]]
[[Computer graphics]]
