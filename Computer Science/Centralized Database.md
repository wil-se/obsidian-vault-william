# Centralized Database
----
A **centralized database** (sometimes abbreviated **CDB**) is a [[Database]] that is located, stored, and maintained in a single location. A centralized database is tipically used by organizations or institutions. Users access the database trough a computrer network which is able to give them access to the data.

### Advantages
- **Data integrity** is maximized and data redundancy is minimised, as the single storing place of all the data also implies that a given set of data only has one primary record. This aids in the maintaining of data as accurate and as consistent as possible and enhances **data reliability**.
- Generally bigger **data security**, as the single data storage location implies only a one possible place from which the database can be attacked and sets of data can be stolen or tampered with.
- **More cost effective** than other types of database systems as labor, power supply and maintenance costs are all minimized.
- **Data kept in the same location** is easier to be changed, re-organized, mirrored, or analyzed.
- **Updates** to any given set of data **are immediately received** by every end-user.

### Disvantages
- **Bottlenecks** can occur as a result of high traffic.
- Limited access by more than one person to the same set of data as **there is only one copy of it and it is maintained in a single location**.
- If there is no fault-tolerant setup and hardware failure occurs, **all the data within the database can be lost**.
- Since there is minimal to no data redundancy, **if a set of data is unexpectedly lost it is very hard to retrieve it back**, in most cases it would have to be done manually.
- Ccentralized database **can be shut down or tampered by its administrators** and relies upon the will of his few owners, since the authority of it is centralized.
