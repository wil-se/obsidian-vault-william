Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks or governments. It was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and has since grown to become the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.

At its core, Bitcoin is based on  [[Blockchain]], which is a [[Distributed Ledger]] that records all transactions made on the network. The blockchain is maintained by a network of computers around the world, known as nodes, that validate and record transactions in real-time. Once a transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain, and becomes a permanent part of the ledger.

The Bitcoin network is designed to be decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority controlling it. Instead, all participants in the network have an equal say in how it operates, and each node has a copy of the entire blockchain. This makes the network highly resistant to censorship and tampering, as no single entity can control it.

One of the most significant features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created, and this cap ensures that the currency is deflationary, meaning that its value is expected to increase over time. This is in contrast to traditional fiat currencies, which are inflationary and can lose value over time due to factors such as government policies or economic conditions.

People can acquire Bitcoins by purchasing them on cryptocurrency exchanges or by mining them. Mining involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners are incentivized to participate in the network through the issuance of new Bitcoins, as well as through transaction fees paid by users.
