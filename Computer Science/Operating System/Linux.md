# Linux
----
Linux is an [[UNIX]]-like open-source [[Operating System]] based on the [[Linux Kernel]]. Linux is tipically packaged as a Linux Distribution.
Distributions include the Linux Kernel and provide system software and libraries, many of which are imported from the [[GNU Project]].
Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has ported to more platforms than any other operating system.
Currently only around 2.3% of desktop computers run linux, but it's the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4%). Linux also runs on embedded systems's firmware.
